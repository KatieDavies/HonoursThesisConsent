<i>This consent form, a copy of which can be download by clicking here, is for your records and reference and is only part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would like more detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, please email Katherine Davies at daviesk5@myumanitoba.ca. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information. </i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: This experiment looks at your ability to accurately read the strength of graphically presented correlations. The goal of the work is to determine how accurately people interpret graphically presented correlations based on characteristics of how the data and superficial aspects of the graphs are presented. <br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>: In this experiment, you will be presented with a series of graphs, one at a time. For each graph, you will be shown a scale from -1 to 1. Your task will be to judge the strength and direction of the correlation depicted in each graph. As you learned in your undergraduate class, a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship between two variables, a correlation of 0 indicates no correlation between two variables, and a correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation between two variables.  All of the answers will be collected by the computer. <br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
There are typically no risks involved in this experiment, greater than what you might experience in your everyday life. You may take any breaks as needed. You are free to stop your participation at any time and without consequence. You will benefit by gaining experience with scientific research in psychology.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Digital data files regarding your interaction with the computer program will be anonymous and, if provided, your email address will be stored independently of the data. Both will be kept indefinitely on a password protected computer and the password protected server "Pavlovia.". There will be no hard copies of the data files. Every effort will be made to assure your anonymity.  <br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>: You will receive 1 participation credit toward your final grade in Introduction to Psychology (PSYC 1200).<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after consenting to participating in the experiment, you may choose to withdraw your participation at any time and without consequence. You can simply close your browser window before or during any trial. <i><b>Data from participants who leave partway through the experiment will not be saved.</b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: Following the experiment, you will be presented with information that explains the experiment in writing. You will be provided with an option to save or print the form to keep for your records and reference. If you are interested in learning about the outcome of this experiment, please leave us with your email address below. A separate window will open where you may enter your email. Your email will be collected independently of your data from the experiment. This will assure that your data will remain completely anonymous. We will send a description of the outcome as soon as possible, but no later than April 30, 2021. A copy of this consent form can be saved or printed to keep for your records and reference.<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The results of this study will be included in Katherine Davies' Honours Thesis in the Department of Psychology.  The results may also be reported in presentations at academic conferences and/or published in an academic journal.  In no case will your data be singled out or identifiable as having been provided by you. Every effort will be made to assure your anonymity. <br/><br/>

<b>Keeping in Touch</b>: If you would like to receive a summary of the results of this experiment, please click here. You will be taken to page where you can provide your email address and we will provide you with a summary of the results after the experiment is completed. Your email will not be linked to your study responses. This is optional.65yyyy/. <br/><br/>

<b>Consent:</b> If you wish to participate in this experiment, please indicate your consent, by clicking the box below.  <br/><br/>

By clicking the box marked "I agree", you are indicating that you have understood to your satisfaction the information regarding participation in the research project and agree to participate as a subject. In no way does this waive your legal rights nor release the researchers, sponsors, or involved institutions from their legal and professional responsibilities. You are free to withdraw from the study at any time, and /or refrain from answering any questions you prefer to omit, without prejudice or consequence.<br/><br/>
